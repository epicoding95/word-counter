# word-counter

#### A program that gathers both a a word and a sentence from a user, then checks how frequently the word appears in the sentence.

#### By Kelar Crisp

## using this program will allow you input any sentence and find out how many times the selected word occurs in said sentence.



### Specs       

| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **I enjoy going to the beach with friends**    | input:  "friends|output: friends occurs 1 time in this sentence|
| **This program only works for whole words, for example if the user input was "I'm walking to the cathedral" and searched to see if "cat" appeared in this sentence it would return 0 times even though "cat" appears in the word "cathedral"**   | input: "Cat"|output: Cat appears 0 times.|
